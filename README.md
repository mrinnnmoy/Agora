## ⚠️ Problem to Solve

Creators face challenges in monetizing their digital goods, often relying on centralized platforms with high fees and limited transparency. There’s a growing need for a decentralized solution that empowers creators to directly sell their content and allows users to make secure purchases using cryptocurrency.

## ✅ Possible Solution

**Agora** addresses these issues by offering a decentralized platform for creators and users with:

1. **Tokenized Digital Goods:** Allows creators to mint their digital goods as ERC-1155 tokens, setting custom supply limits.
2. **Inclusive Access:** Supports both web2 and web3 social logins for a seamless user experience.
3. **Decentralized Marketplace:** Enables users to browse, discover and purchase digital goods directly from creators.
4. **Blockchain Security:** Leverages the Ethereum blockchain for secure, transparent transactions.
